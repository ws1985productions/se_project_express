# WTWR (What to Wear?): is a back-end project that provides a RESTful API for managing user profiles and clothing items. The application is designed to serve as the server-side logic for a weather-based wardrobe recommendation system. It allows users to:

View and manage user profiles.
Add, view, and delete clothing items.
Like or dislike clothing items to personalize recommendations.
This back-end is built using Node.js and Express.js and integrates a MongoDB database to store user and clothing data.

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
