A back end project setting up request and response processes for the database along with model schema requirements. User authorization has been implemented and we are testing through Postman.

In this project we used Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, bcrypt, cors and validator. Express was used to handle data sent from the user, MongoDB to set up the database, Mongoose to set up schemas, bcrypt to handle password hashing, cors for the client to interact with the server and validator to validate input URLs.
